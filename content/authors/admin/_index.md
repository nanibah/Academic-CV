Hey, I'm Niba! I am Robotics master's graduate from the University of Michigan, currently working with [Dr.Robert Gregg](https://gregg.engin.umich.edu/) on personalizing gait-state for exoskeletons. 

I collaborated with [Dr.Katie Skinner](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/katherine-skinner/) for my directed study on enhancing perception for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Prior to my master's, I worked as a R&D Engineer at [Hachidori Robotics](https://hachidorirobotics.com/), where I developed production-grade software for deployment of Autonomous Mobile Robots enabling warehouse automation. I also interned at [IGCAR](https://www.igcar.gov.in/) and worked with [Dr.Joseph Winston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjwinston/?originalSubdomain=in) on resolving spatial awareness for nuclear reactor core inspection systems. 

Looking forward to connect with you :)
