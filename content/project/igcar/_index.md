The Reactor Core Viewing System â€“ Room Temperature (RCVS-RT) is a tool used for inspection of nucelar reactor core internals for structural deformities or foreign objects using vision probes consisting of a downward facing and two sideward facing cameras. A nuclear reactor core is of hexagonal lattice structure. Each hexagon tube is referred to as a sub-assembly. The inspection procedure involving extracting a sub-assembly and inserting the RCVS-RT. As the vision probes travels downwards, it is rotated to check for deformaties, thus giving rise to the lack of orientation awareness. In this project, this problem is resolved, achieving real-time orientational awareness by fusing data from IMU and the downward facing camera.
